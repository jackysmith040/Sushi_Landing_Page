# 🍣 Japanese Sushi Restaurant Landing Page 🍣

Welcome to the landing page of my delightful Japanese Sushi Restaurant! This page is not just about sushi, it's about the whole experience. 🎉

## 🎯 Purpose

This project was created as a practice to review the basics of website development. It's a fun and engaging way to showcase my skills while creating something visually appealing and functional.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

This landing page was built using the following technologies:

1. HTML - For the structure of the page.
2. CSS - For styling and making the page look beautiful.
3. AOS library - For those cool animations you see.
4. Mobile responsive design - So it looks great on any device.

## 📣 Call to Action
